### Introduction

With just a few pots and some creativity, my balcony transformed into a tiny sanctuary of green.

### Benefits

I started with herbs like basil and mint, then added colorful flowers and leafy greens.

### Challenges

Caring for the plants became a daily joyâ€”watering, pruning, and watching them grow.

### Daily Practice

Even in a small space, nature found a way to thrive and bring me calm.

### Reflection

This project reminded me that growth starts with small, consistent effort.
