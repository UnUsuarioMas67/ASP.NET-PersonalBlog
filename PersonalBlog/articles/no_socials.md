### Introduction

Without social media, I was more present. I had deeper conversations and more mental space.

### Benefits

I found myself reaching for my phone less and enjoying real-life moments more.

### Challenges

Reading, writing, and even doing nothing became richer experiences without distractions.

### Daily Practice

The initial fear of missing out faded, replaced by a sense of calm and clarity.

### Reflection

Now, I set weekly "no screen" periods to maintain that balance and perspective.
