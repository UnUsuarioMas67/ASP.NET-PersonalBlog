### Introduction

Going offline for a week was challenging but enlightening. It showed me how much attention screens take from my life.

### Benefits

At first, I felt anxiousâ€”what if I missed something important? But that feeling passed quickly.

### Challenges

Without the constant stream of updates, I had more time to read, cook, and connect with people face to face.

### Daily Practice

I noticed my sleep improved and my mind felt less scattered.

### Reflection

This experience taught me that being present is more valuable than being constantly connected.
